## Singleton Design Pattern

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance.<br>
One of the well-known "Gang of Four" design patterns, which describe how to solve recurring problems in object-oriented software, the pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

More specifically, the singleton pattern allows objects to:

- Ensure they only have one instance
- Provide easy access to that instance
- Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the constructors of a class)

The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
